# Welcome to the configuration of SimpleSkyblock!
# Below are some of the customizable parts of
# SimpleSkyblock! If you need something special, feel
# free to send me an email at themanhimself@garet.holiday



# +-------------------------------------------+
# |       WORLD GENERATION / MANAGEMENT       |
# +-------------------------------------------+

# SimpleSkyblock is equipped with a world generator which
# will generate a blank world with no blocks. To use it,
# simply add the following to bukkit.yml:
# worlds:
#   [world name]:
#     generator: SimpleSkyblock

# To change the biome of the world generated, edit the
# following line.
BIOME: PLAINS

# To change the name of the world which all skyblock islands
# will generate, edit the line below. If the world doesn't
# exist, we'll create a new one for you using SimpleSkyblock's
# empty world generator.
WORLD: world

# The height at which the islands will generate. This is the Y
# value at which the bedrock block will be.
ISLAND_HEIGHT: 70

# The width of the claimed island plot. Changing this will
# change the size of the claimed island plot in the X
# direction. The negative-most block in the X will be half an
# island width away from the island border. Islands will, by
# default, have 1 block of no-man's land between them.
ISLAND_WIDTH: 5000

# Island depth is the same as island width, but in the Z
# direction.
ISLAND_DEPTH: 5000

# The limits are how far SimpleSkyblock is allowed to generate
# islands. The islands will generate in the following pattern:
# The first island will generate at -LIMIT_X, -LIMIT_Z. Every
# time a new island is generated, it will add an ISLAND_WIDTH
# to the X value, until it hits LIMIT_X, after which it will
# go back to -LIMIT_X and increment Z by one ISLAND_DEPTH.
LIMIT_X: 29990000

# LIMIT_Z is the limit in which islands can generate in the
# SimpleSkyblock world.
LIMIT_Z: 29990000

# The settings listed above allow for 35,976,004 islands, a
# number I'd be suprised if you hit



# +------------------------------+
# |       GENERAL SETTINGS       |

# CHAT_PREFIX is the "name tag" for SimpleSkyblock when it

# is active for the whole server, not just the skyblock
# world.
DISABLE_PLAYER_COLLISIONS: true

# USE_CHATROOMS defines whether to use SimpleSkyblock's
# chatrooms. They create seperate channels for each island,

# disabled, the server goes back to default chatting or
# lets another plugin take over.
USE_CHATROOMS: true

# chatrooms in. Using * will use the chatrooms for all
# worlds.

# islands as much as they want. This can be exploited, so
# island resets are generally limited. An operator can

INFINITE_RESETS: false

# USE_NETHER determines whether to allow players to have a
# nether island.
USE_NETHER: true

GENERATE_ORES: true

# GENERATOR_ORES are the ores which will be generated,
# along with the percent chance of generation. These do

# LEVEL_POINTS are the points which you players get
# added towards their islands based on each block
# placed, destroyed, or generated.

# island starts with 100 points by default.
# All other blocks not listed are calculated using
# the value of 'Default'.

# BLAST_PROCESSING toggles whether items can be
# blasted to create other materials. This includes

# false.
BLAST_PROCESSING: true

# bonemeal mechanics or not. The custom mechanics
